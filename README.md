*Built during the GDG Live Pakistan "Vibe Code till Sehri" 2026!*

## The Vision
Modern work is filled with distractions. **Deep Work Vibe** is a ruthless Pomodoro tracker built right into your browser. When you start a session, it doesn't just count down the time—it actively monitors and instantly closes distracting tabs (like YouTube or Instagram) so you can maintain your flow state.

## Features
- **Sleek UI:** Dark-mode, neon-accented timer that lives in your toolbar.
- **Savage Blocker:** Automatically closes tabs that match your blocklist while the timer is running.
- **Custom Settings:** Add or remove specific domains you want to avoid during focus time.
- **Streak Tracking:** Earn a 🔥 streak for every completed 25-minute session. Locally stored!

## Tech Stack
- Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)
- HTML5 / CSS3 (Custom Dark Theme)
- Chrome Extension Manifest V3 (Service Workers, Local Storage APIs)
- **Methodology:** 100% Vibe Coding
